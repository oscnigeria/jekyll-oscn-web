Collaboration is a key aspect of advancing open science in Nigeria. At Open Science Community Nigeria, we provide a platform for researchers, scientists, and individuals interested in open science to connect and collaborate on projects. Our community forum allows members to share ideas, ask questions, and offer support to one another.

We also host events and workshops where members can meet in person and collaborate on open science projects. By working together, we can promote a culture of openness and accountability in Nigerian science and help advance scientific knowledge. Collaboration can help to promote innovation and new ideas, and it can also help to address complex scientific challenges.

At Open Science Community Nigeria, we are committed to promoting collaboration and providing a platform for researchers and individuals interested in open science to connect and work together.
