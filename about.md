Open Science Community Nigeria, a nonprofit organization committed to promoting open science practices in Nigeria. Inspired by the Open Science (OS) movement that prioritizes transparency, accessibility, and efficiency in scientific research and education, we founded the OSCN. Presently, there are NO existing Open Science communities in Nigeria that uphold the responsible execution of research while endorsing Open Science principles and practices.

We aim to create a culture of openness and accountability in Nigerian science by advocating for the adoption of open science principles and practices. At Open Science Community Nigeria, we believe that science can only progress if research is conducted transparently and reproducibly. By embracing open science practices, researchers can increase the quality and impact of their research, as well as foster a collaborative and inclusive scientific culture.

Our scientist-driven organization is dedicated to advancing science through education, advocacy, and collaboration. We work tirelessly to promote open science practices by providing educational resources and training programs to researchers, advocating for open science policies and practices at institutional and governmental levels, and fostering collaborations among researchers, institutions, and other stakeholders in the scientific community.

## Our Vision

Our aim is to mobilize and engage various groups in Nigeria, including scientists, researchers, clinicians, stakeholders, and students. We strive to encourage dialogues on Open Science, empowering and inspiring them to improve the quality of research outputs. As a community, we are a part of the International Network of Open Science & Scholarship Communities (INOSC). Please note that **you do not require any expertise in Open Science to join the OSCN.** Furthermore, being a part of the OSCN does not necessitate any commitment to specific practices. We are all gathered here to learn, exchange knowledge, and foster insightful discussions! Kindly adhere to our Code of Conduct during your participation.

Join Us as we collaborate towards integrating Open Science practices in Nigeria.
